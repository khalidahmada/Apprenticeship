#The P'unk Ave Apprenticeship Program#

##About##
In the fall of 2012, P'unk Avenue began a new program aimed at helping intentional developers and designers develop real-world skills in the context of purpose oriented work.
This simple webpage, hosted on GitHub Pages, roughly sketches the aims and means of that program.

##Technology##
This page is built on Foundation 3.2 using HTML and SASS. 

##Contributing##
Forks should be made from the P'unk Ave organization repo and pull requests will be handled there.
